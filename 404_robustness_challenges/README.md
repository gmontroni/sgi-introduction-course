# Robustness Challenges

This last component of the robustness challenge is open ended. I have included a handful of surface meshes in the `data/` directory, all of which are very "bad" quality, in various sense.

Your challenge is to do _any_ geometry processing with these models. Run any algorithm you have seen thus far in the tutorials, or even any routine in `gptoolbox`! Many of them will fail; you may need to re-mesh or otherwise process the results to have any success.

Good luck, and do share your results and workflow if you succeed!
