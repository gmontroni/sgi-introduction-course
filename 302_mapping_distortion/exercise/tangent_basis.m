function B = tangent_basis(a_3d, b_3d, c_3d)
    % Given a non-degenerate triangle a, b, c in 3D,
    % compute an orthonormal basis for vectors in its tangent plane.
    % Return the following 3-by-2 matrix:
    % First column: normalized direction from vertex a to b
    % Second column: orthogonal direction obtained by 90Â° counterclockwise rotation
