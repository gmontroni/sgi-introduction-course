# Robustness Puzzle 2

This script tries to load a mesh, compute geodesic distance (the distance along the surface from some specified source), and visualize the result.

Two different meshes of Spot the Cow are included. On one mesh, it will succeed. But on the other, you will get an error!

I promise nothing is wrong with the implementation of the algorithm computing distance, something is wrong with the "bad" mesh input. Your task is to figure out what is wrong with the "bad" mesh, using any tools you would like. Also, try to fix the problem!
